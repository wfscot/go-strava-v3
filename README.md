# go-strava-v3
Swaggerhub Go Codegen of Strava's V3 API

Generated on 24 January, 2021

This is the Go client generated by Swaggerhub's client codegen with only the following modifications:
1. The zipfile was unzipped in the `client` directory with package changed from the original `swagger` to `client`
1. A Go module was initialized in the `client` directory via `go mod init; go build`

Please see `build_from_zip.sh` for details.

This is here primarily for my own hobbyist purposes, but anyone else is free to use it.  I make no commitments to keeping it up-to-date with the latest Strava API.  Please refer to Strava's [docs](https://developers.strava.com/docs/) for the latest info.
